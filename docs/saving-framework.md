Great questions — these two topics are core to your product:

1. **How to track progress when you DON'T have real-time spending data?**
2. **Which saving/wealth-building frameworks (like 5 jars) should your app include?**

I’ll answer both with CLEAR strategy and options you can implement.

# ⭐ PART 1 — **How to Track User Progress Without Real-Time Spending Data**

Since you cannot automatically read their bank transactions (unless they connect a bank aggregator), your app still needs to provide strong tracking WITHOUT any live financial data.

Here are three practical approaches you can combine.

---

# ✅ **Approach A — “Self-Reported Tracking + Smart Nudges” (Works for MVP)**

This is the simplest and most scalable method.

### **You track progress purely from:**

* The user’s monthly input
* The recommended target
* Their stated income/expenses/savings

### How it works:

1. App sets a "Monthly Target Saving/Investment" based on their plan.
2. Every month, app asks a simple question:
   **“How much did you save/invest this month?”**
3. User enters number (or uploads screenshot).
4. App checks:

   * Above target → “Great! You're ahead”
   * On target → “Perfect—stay consistent”
   * Below target → “You need ₹X more per month to stay on track”

### Pros:

* Zero friction
* Users feel “in control”
* Perfect for early version

### Cons:

* Depends on user honesty
* Not fully automated

But **95% of finance habit apps use this model**.

---

# ✅ **Approach B — “Statement Upload + Auto Parsing” (Optional for advanced users)**

Yes — you CAN ask users to upload:

* Bank statements
* Credit card statements
* Investment account statements
* Salary slips

### How it works:

1. User uploads PDF/CSV.
2. Your app parses transactions using OCR + rules engine.
3. App categorizes income/expenses.
4. App compares actual behaviour vs planned strategy.

### What this enables:

✔ Accurate tracking
✔ Spending categories
✔ Savings rate detection
✔ Automatic insights and warnings

### Pros:

* High accuracy
* Great power-user feature
* Makes your app feel “smarter”

### Cons:

* Privacy-sensitive
* Requires good PDF parsing
* Extra friction

**You can make this optional**, so beginners won’t feel scared.

---

# ✅ **Approach C — “Hybrid Model: Estimated Tracking + Correction Using User Milestones”**

This is clever and works GREAT without live data.

### How it works:

Your app estimates progress based on:

* Initial inputs
* Planned monthly contributions
* Expected growth rate

THEN, every:

* 30 days (or)
* 90 days (or)
* Important milestones

You ask short “check-in questions,” e.g.:

**“What is your current savings amount?”**
**“Did you invest last month?”**
**“Any unexpected expenses this month?”**

This lets your app adjust the model WITHOUT needing bank-level data.

### Pros:

* Light friction
* Good accuracy over time
* Feels personalized
* Zero privacy concerns

---

# ⭐ So which should YOU choose?

### **For MVP (first version):**

👉 **Use Approach A + C**
(Simple reporting + check-ins + nudges)

### **For advanced users later:**

👉 **Offer Approach B as optional**
(Statement upload for powerful insights)

---

# ⭐ PART 2 — What the app monitors (even without real-time data)

Your app will track:

### **1) Monthly savings vs target**

“Target: ₹10,000 → Actual: ₹7,000 → You are 30% behind.”

### **2) Goal completion timeline**

“With current saving rate, your 5-year goal will take 6.3 years.”

### **3) Investment growth projections**

Even without live data, user inputs + expected return models give realistic forecasts.

### **4) Habit consistency**

How many months user hit their saving target.

### **5) Risk mismatch**

If user switches preference (e.g., too many short-term expenses → adjust plan).

### **6) Emergency buffer health**

Every quarter your app checks:
“Do you still have 3 months emergency fund?”

### **7) Behavioural nudges**

Weekly or monthly nudges:

* “Increase SIP by ₹300 to stay ahead.”
* “You are 80% on track this month!”
* “Your spending was higher than usual—reduce unnecessary expenses next week.”
