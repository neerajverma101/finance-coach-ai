## 💔 The Problem

Most people struggle with money because:
- **They don't know where they stand** - No clear picture of their financial health
- **They follow random advice** - Generic tips that don't fit their situation
- **They feel overwhelmed** - Too much jargon, too many options
- **They give up quickly** - No clear path or tracking system
- **They can't stay consistent** - No accountability or nudges

**Existing solutions are broken:**
- Banks show accounts, not insights
- Advisors are expensive and pushy  
- Budgeting apps are too manual
- Investment platforms assume knowledge
- None of them actually *teach* or *coach*

### ✅ AI DOES
- **Explain** recommendations in simple language

- **Orchestrate** complex workflows (parsing statements, running simulations)
- **Personalize** language based on your knowledge level

**Why this matters:**
- **Trustworthy** - Every number is traceable, auditable
- **Explainable** - You always know "why"
- **Compliant** - No black-box decisions
- **Affordable** - AI only where needed, not everywhere
